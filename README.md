# Automate Identification and Recognition of Handwritten Text from an Image

![CRNN Model](images/crnn_model.png)

This repository contains the implementation of a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) model designed to detect and recognize handwritten text from images. The CRNN combines convolutional layers for feature extraction with recurrent layers for sequence modeling, making it well-suited for tasks involving sequential data like text.

## Introduction

Handwritten text recognition is a challenging task due to the variability in handwriting styles, orientations, and the presence of noise in images. This project leverages a CRNN architecture to accurately detect and recognize handwritten text from images, making it suitable for applications such as digitizing handwritten documents, automated form processing, and more.

## Features

- **End-to-end text detection and recognition**: Automatically detect and recognize text from input images.
- **CRNN architecture**: Combines CNNs for feature extraction with RNNs for sequence modeling.
- **CTC loss function**: Utilizes Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for sequence prediction without pre-segmented labels.
- **Preprocessing utilities**: Includes image preprocessing and augmentation utilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VMD7/Automate-identification-and-recognition-of-handwritten-text-from-an-image
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Architecture

The CRNN model architecture consists of the following components:

- Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from input images.

- Recurrent Layers (Bidirectional LSTM): Model the sequential nature of the text.

- CTC Loss Function: Handles the alignment between predicted and actual sequences.
